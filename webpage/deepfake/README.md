# Real-Time Deepfake Detection via Frame-Level EfficientNet  Ensemble and Client-Server Deployment

## Application Implementation :

The Deepfake Detection Web App allows users to upload videos directly from their browser, send them to a backend server running a deep learning model, and receive predictions about the video's authenticity.
Built with React.js for a modern, responsive UI and Axios for efficient network communication, the app delivers real-time results along with optional visual explanations using Grad-CAM heatmaps.

This web-based system bridges cutting-edge machine learning with a user-friendly online interface, enabling anyone to verify video content from any device with a web browser  without needing to install an app.
























# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
